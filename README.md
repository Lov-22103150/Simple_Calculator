The provided C++ code defines a Calculator class and a main function to perform basic arithmetic operations based on user input.



Analysis of the Code:
Calculator Class:

Defines basic arithmetic operations (add, min, mult, div, power, remain) as member functions.
Each function modifies the member variable x to store the result of the operation.
The constructor initializes the object and performs the operation based on the operator (oper).
Main Function:

Prompts the user to enter an expression in the format operand1 operator operand2.
Reads input values and operator from the user.
Validates the operator; if invalid, prompts the user to re-enter.
Creates a Calculator object (calc) with the operands and operator provided.
Outputs the formatted expression and the result of the calculation.
Issues and Improvements:
Naming Conflict: The use of min for subtraction conflicts with std::min from <algorithm>. It should be renamed for clarity.
Division Operator: Uses : instead of / for division, which is unconventional.
Unused Members: a, b, and oper in the Calculator class are not used correctly or at all; they should either be utilized or removed.
Error Handling: The current implementation lacks robust error handling, such as division by zero.
Overall, the code provides a basic framework for performing arithmetic operations based on user input, but it requires refinement for better readability, functionality, and error handling.
